Hey! My name is Christian and I am a geospatial application developer at [Blue Raster](https://www.blueraster.com/).

My day to day work focuses on building mapping applications for public, private, and nonprofit organizations, primarily using TypeScript, React, Redux and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

Outside of work, I am an avid triathlete and spend my free time training for endurance sports.
