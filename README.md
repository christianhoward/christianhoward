Hey! My name is Christian, and I am a software engineer with an area of expertise in front-end engineering and mapping.

Most recently, I worked as a software engineer at Compass on the Maps Platform team where we built and maintained an internal maps API for Compass application teams to use, including the public facing [Consumer Search](https://www.compass.com/homes-for-sale) application. 

Prior to joining Compass, I worked as a geospatial application developer at Blue Raster where my day-to-day work focused on building mapping applications for public, private, and nonprofit organizations, primarily using TypeScript, React, Redux and the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

In my free time, I am an avid triathlete and spend my time training for endurance sports.
